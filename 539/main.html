I found a quote from Andy Kryza from The Thrillest describe it as “a melting pot cuisine that takes elements of Chinese, Malaysian, and mixes in huge amount of Spanish influence.” For me, it’s food that I grew up eating.</p>
    <p> The following pages has an assortment of different food items. This is not a complete list of all the food that Filipino cuisine has to offer, but it’s a good start on getting acquainted with foods you might encounter in the Philippines.</p>
